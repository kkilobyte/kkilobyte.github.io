# [kbsite on github.io](https://kkilobyte.github.io) is now outdated
Same with [kbsite on repl](https://site.kkilo.repl.co), [kbsite on github.io](https://kkilobyte.github.io) is now outdated.

This means both the Repl and Github websites will redirect to the new kbsite website.

The new website is [kkilouwu.bio](https://kkilouwu.bio), and both Repl and Github will redirect to it.
