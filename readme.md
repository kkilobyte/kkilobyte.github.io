## Purpose
The purpose of KBSite is to host media files, share my tech nerd shit, help bypass rescrictions, etc. For example, to bypass ContentKeeper and Chrome Policies, I'd use a proxy. To unenroll a Chromebook on <v110, I'd use sh1mmer, <v117 e-halcyon, etc., I'll also test things with HTML.
## Site redirects to Replit even though the site is a Github.io??
Report it as an issue [here](https://github.com/kkilobyte/kkilobyte.github.io/issues).
