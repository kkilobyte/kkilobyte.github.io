# Kilobyte's Website :3
### [Click here to go to site](https://kkilobyte.github.io)
## Purpose
The purpose of KBSite is to host media files, share my tech nerd shit, help bypass rescrictions, etc. For example, to bypass ContentKeeper and Chrome Policies, I'd use a proxy. To unenroll a Chromebook on versions v110 or lower, I'd use sh1mmer, on a Cb with versions below v117, I'd use e-halcyon, etc., I'll also test some things with HTML on this site.
## Site redirects to Replit even though the site is a Github Page??
Report it as an issue [here](https://github.com/kkilobyte/kkilobyte.github.io/issues).
